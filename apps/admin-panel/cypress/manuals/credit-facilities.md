## Introduction

Credit facilities represent a line of credit extended to a customer. Proper management of these facilities ensures that customers have access to the agreed-upon funds while maintaining sufficient collateral and compliance with organizational policies.

This guide covers the full lifecycle:  
- **Creating a New Credit Facility:** Setting up the facility with the appropriate amount and terms.  
- **Updating Collateral:** Adjusting the collateral values as conditions change, ensuring the facility remains adequately secured.  
- **Disbursals:** Releasing funds to the customer once the facility is active and fully secured.
