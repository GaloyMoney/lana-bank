## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

### Steps to log in to the admin panel locally:

1. Go to `http://localhost:4455/admin-panel` URL to open the admin panel login.
2. Enter the email. For now, we have two allowed emails: `super.user@example.com`.
3. Open MailHog to get the email magic link: `http://localhost:8025/`.
4. Click on the magic link to log in to the admin panel.
