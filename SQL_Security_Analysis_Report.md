# SQL Security Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes all SQL code in the Lana Bank codebase for potential security vulnerabilities. The analysis covers Rust backend code using SQLx, Meltano transformation SQL files, database configuration, and operational scripts.

## Overall Security Assessment: **MODERATE RISK**

The codebase demonstrates good security practices in most areas but has several vulnerabilities that require attention.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Positive Security Practices

1. **Parameterized Queries**: The Rust backend consistently uses SQLx's `sqlx::query!` macro with proper parameter binding, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks.

2. **Type Safety**: SQLx provides compile-time query validation and type safety for database operations.

3. **Transaction Management**: Proper use of database transactions in critical operations.

4. **Structured Logging**: Database operations include proper instrumentation and logging.

## üö® Critical Security Issues

### 1. Hardcoded Database Credentials (HIGH RISK)

**Location**: Multiple configuration files
```bash
# .envrc
export AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN="postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5436/pg"

# docker-compose.yml
environment: [ POSTGRES_USER=dbuser, POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret, POSTGRES_DB=default ]
```

**Risk**: Credentials are stored in plaintext in version control
**Impact**: Complete database compromise if repository is accessed by unauthorized users
**Recommendation**: Use environment variables, secrets management, or encrypted configuration

### 2. Raw SQL Execution in Operational Scripts (MEDIUM RISK)

**Location**: `Makefile` lines 203-209
```bash
get-admin-login-code:
	@$${ENGINE_DEFAULT:-docker} exec lana-bank-kratos-admin-pg-1 psql -U dbuser -d default -t -c "SELECT body FROM courier_messages WHERE recipient='$(EMAIL)' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
```

**Risk**: Command injection through EMAIL environment variable
**Impact**: Potential command execution and data exfiltration
**Recommendation**: Validate and sanitize the EMAIL parameter or use safer database access methods

### 3. JavaScript UDF with Potential Code Injection (MEDIUM RISK)

**Location**: `meltano/transform/macros/time-value-money/udf_loan_pv.sql`
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf_loan_pv (interest_rate FLOAT64, times ARRAY<FLOAT64>, cash_flows ARRAY<FLOAT64>)
RETURNS FLOAT64
LANGUAGE js
AS r"""
  // JavaScript code that processes user input
"""
```

**Risk**: JavaScript UDFs can potentially execute arbitrary code if input validation is insufficient
**Impact**: Code execution within database context
**Recommendation**: Review input validation and consider using SQL-native functions where possible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risk Issues

### 4. Database Schema Modifications (MEDIUM RISK)

**Location**: `lana/entity-rollups/src/templates/rollup_table_alter.sql.hbs`
```sql
ALTER TABLE {{../rollup_table_name}} ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS {{this.name}} {{this.sql_type}};
```

**Risk**: Dynamic schema changes based on template variables
**Impact**: Potential schema corruption or privilege escalation
**Recommendation**: Implement strict validation for table names and column types

### 5. Mass Delete Operations (LOW-MEDIUM RISK)

**Location**: Various locations in `.sqlx` cache files
```sql
DELETE FROM job_executions WHERE id = $1
```

**Risk**: While parameterized, these operations could cause data loss if misused
**Impact**: Data integrity issues
**Recommendation**: Implement soft deletes and audit trails for critical data

## üîç Areas Requiring Review

### 6. Database Connection Configuration

- **Location**: Throughout the codebase
- **Issue**: Multiple database connection patterns with varying security levels
- **Recommendation**: Standardize secure connection practices with TLS encryption

### 7. Role-Based Access Control

- **Location**: `core/access/src/` modules
- **Observation**: Comprehensive RBAC system implemented
- **Recommendation**: Regular audit of role assignments and permissions

### 8. Audit Logging

- **Location**: Database operations throughout the codebase
- **Status**: Partial implementation
- **Recommendation**: Ensure all sensitive database operations are logged

## ‚úÖ Low Risk Observations

### 9. Analytics SQL (LOW RISK)

The numerous UNION ALL operations in Meltano transformation files are legitimate analytics queries for business intelligence purposes and do not present security risks.

### 10. Prepared Statements Usage

All Rust backend SQL operations properly use prepared statements through SQLx, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks.

## Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Remove hardcoded credentials** from all configuration files
2. **Implement secrets management** for database credentials  
3. **Validate EMAIL parameter** in Makefile operations

### Short Term (High Priority)

1. **Review JavaScript UDF security** and implement input validation
2. **Add validation** for dynamic schema modification templates
3. **Implement monitoring** for privileged database operations

### Medium Term (Medium Priority)

1. **Standardize database connection security** across all components
2. **Implement comprehensive audit logging** for all database operations
3. **Regular security review** of RBAC configurations

### Long Term (Low Priority)

1. **Database activity monitoring** implementation
2. **Automated security scanning** for SQL code
3. **Regular penetration testing** of database layer

## Compliance Considerations

For a banking application, consider implementing:
- **SOX compliance** requirements for financial data integrity
- **PCI DSS** standards for payment data protection
- **Data encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Access logging** and monitoring requirements

## Conclusion

The Lana Bank codebase demonstrates solid fundamental security practices with parameterized queries and type safety. However, the critical issues with hardcoded credentials and raw SQL execution in operational scripts require immediate attention. The JavaScript UDF functionality should be reviewed for potential code injection vulnerabilities.

The overall security posture is good but can be significantly improved by addressing the identified issues, particularly around credential management and operational security practices.
