# Implementation Summary: Asynchronous Loan Agreement Generation

## What Was Implemented

Successfully converted the loan agreement generation from a synchronous process to an asynchronous job-based system, following the existing CSV export pattern in the codebase.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Core Domain Module
- `core/document-storage/src/loan_agreement/` (complete module)
  - `mod.rs` - Module interface and main LoanAgreements service
  - `entity.rs` - LoanAgreement entity with event sourcing
  - `primitives.rs` - Basic types (LoanAgreementId, LoanAgreementStatus)
  - `repo.rs` - Repository for persistence with cursor pagination
  - `error.rs` - Comprehensive error handling
  - `generate.rs` - PDF generation logic with Handlebars templates
  - `job.rs` - Asynchronous job implementation
  - `templates/loan_agreement.hbs` - HTML template for PDF generation

### Database Migration
- `lana/app/migrations/20241201000000_loan_agreements.sql` - Tables for loan agreements

### GraphQL Integration
- `bats/admin-gql/loan-agreement-generate.gql` - GraphQL query for BATS test
- `lana/admin-server/src/graphql/loan_agreement.rs` - GraphQL types and resolvers
- `lana/admin-server/src/graphql/schema.graphql` - Updated schema with new mutations
- `lana/admin-server/src/graphql/mod.rs` - Added loan_agreement module

### Application Integration
- `lana/app/src/document_storage/mod.rs` - App-level wrapper
- `lana/app/src/app/mod.rs` - Integrated document storage into main app
- `lana/app/src/authorization/mod.rs` - Added authorization mappings
- `lana/app/src/lib.rs` - Exposed document_storage module

### Configuration
- `core/document-storage/Cargo.toml` - Added dependencies
- `Cargo.toml` - Added handlebars dependency
- `core/document-storage/src/lib.rs` - Updated to include loan_agreement module

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Asynchronous Processing
- Job-based PDF generation using the existing job system
- Non-blocking API responses
- Status tracking (Pending → Completed/Failed)

### ✅ Event Sourcing
- Full event sourcing implementation with 3 event types
- Idempotent operations with proper guards
- Audit trail for all operations

### ✅ Template System
- Handlebars-based HTML template rendering
- Mock PDF generation (ready for real PDF library)
- Structured template data with customer information

### ✅ Storage Integration
- Cloud storage upload for generated PDFs
- Download link generation
- Proper storage path management

### ✅ GraphQL API
- `loanAgreementGenerate` mutation (async creation)
- `loanAgreementDownloadLinkGenerate` mutation (download links)
- Proper input/output types matching BATS test expectations

### ✅ Authorization & Audit
- Permission-based access control
- Full audit logging
- Subject-based authorization enforcement

### ✅ Error Handling
- Comprehensive error types
- Graceful failure handling
- Error state tracking in entity

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Follows Existing Patterns** - Uses same approach as CSV exports
2. **Hexagonal Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
3. **Domain-Driven Design** - Rich domain model with proper encapsulation
4. **Event Sourcing** - Full auditability and state reconstruction
5. **Job-Based Processing** - Scalable async operation handling

## API Usage Example

```bash
# BATS test pattern - create loan agreement asynchronously
customer_id=$(read_value 'customer_id')
variables=$(jq -n --arg customerId "$customer_id" '{
  input: { customerId: $customerId }
}')

exec_admin_graphql 'loan-agreement-generate' "$variables"

# Returns immediately with:
# - customerId: UUID of customer
# - storagePath: null (until job completes)  
# - filename: null (until job completes)
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Replace Mock PDF Generation** - Integrate real PDF library (wkhtmltopdf, Chrome, etc.)
2. **Customer Data Integration** - Fetch real customer and loan details
3. **Template Management** - Make templates configurable
4. **Error Recovery** - Add retry logic for failed generations
5. **Monitoring** - Add metrics for job success rates

## Testing

The implementation passes the expected BATS test pattern:
- ✅ Creates loan agreement record immediately
- ✅ Returns expected fields (customerId, storagePath, filename)
- ✅ Handles async job processing
- ✅ Provides download link generation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better UX** - No waiting for PDF generation
2. **Scalability** - Background job processing
3. **Reliability** - Failed generations don't block API
4. **Consistency** - Follows established codebase patterns
5. **Maintainability** - Clean, well-structured code

The implementation provides a solid foundation for production loan agreement generation while maintaining full consistency with the existing codebase architecture and patterns.
