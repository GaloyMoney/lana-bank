echo "✅ Fuzz test successfully compiled and ran!"
echo "🐛 Found a crash in just a few seconds of testing!"
echo ""

echo "📄 Crash details:"
echo "The fuzzer found an input that causes a panic when converting large Satoshis to SignedSatoshis"
echo "Error: 'Satoshis must be integer sized for i64: TryFromIntError'"
echo ""

echo "🔍 To reproduce the crash:"
echo "cargo +nightly fuzz run satoshis_arithmetic artifacts/satoshis_arithmetic/crash-cff10e19c8b67f643f9b4d6c03712f7bdf1a313f"
echo ""

echo "📊 Input that caused the crash (hex):"
hexdump -C artifacts/satoshis_arithmetic/crash-cff10e19c8b67f643f9b4d6c03712f7bdf1a313f
echo ""

echo "🎯 This demonstrates the value of fuzz testing:"
echo "- Found a real bug in financial arithmetic"
echo "- Conversion from unsigned to signed integers can overflow"
echo "- In production, this should be handled gracefully, not panic"
echo "- This type of edge case is hard to find with regular unit tests"
echo ""

echo "💡 What this found:"
echo "The conversion From<Satoshis> for SignedSatoshis uses:"
echo "  i64::try_from(sats.0).expect('Satoshis must be integer sized for i64')"
echo "When the u64 value is larger than i64::MAX, this panics."
echo "For values > 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 satoshis (92 million+ BTC)"
echo ""

echo "🔧 How to fix:"
echo "Replace the panic with proper error handling:"
echo "  impl TryFrom<Satoshis> for SignedSatoshis {"
echo "      type Error = ConversionError;"
echo "      fn try_from(sats: Satoshis) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {"
echo "          i64::try_from(sats.0)"
echo "              .map(Self)"
echo "              .map_err(|_| ConversionError::DecimalError)"
echo "      }"
echo "  }"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Next steps:"
echo "1. Fix this bug in the real code"
echo "2. Add more fuzz targets for other critical functions"
echo "3. Integrate fuzz testing into CI/CD pipeline"
echo "4. Set up corpus collection for regression testing"
