# XSS Security Analysis - Lana Bank Core Banking Application

## Executive Summary

This analysis examined all entry points in the Lana Bank core banking application codebase for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The application consists of a Rust backend with Axum web framework, Next.js frontend applications, and GraphQL APIs.

## Overall Security Posture

**GOOD**: The application demonstrates strong security practices with minimal direct XSS vulnerabilities due to:
- Use of React's built-in XSS protection (automatic escaping)
- Strong typing with TypeScript and Rust
- No usage of dangerous HTML injection patterns
- Modern framework security defaults

**AREAS OF CONCERN**: Several potential vulnerabilities were identified that require attention.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### ðŸ”´ HIGH: URL Parameter Injection in Server Action

**Location**: `apps/admin-panel/app/customers/server-actions.ts:13`

```typescript
const customerId = formData.get("customerId")
if (!customerId || typeof customerId !== "string") {
  redirect(`/customers`)
}
redirect(`/customers?customerId=${customerId}`)
```

**Issue**: The `customerId` parameter is directly concatenated into a redirect URL without proper encoding.

**Attack Vector**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript through the URL parameter:
```
customerId="><script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

**Recommendation**: Use proper URL encoding:
```typescript
redirect(`/customers?customerId=${encodeURIComponent(customerId)}`)
```

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Webhook Input Validation

**Location**: `lana/admin-server/src/custodian_webhooks.rs:10-20`

```rust
async fn handle_webhook(
    Extension(app): Extension<LanaApp>,
    Path(provider): Path<String>,
    headers: HeaderMap,
    uri: Uri,
    Json(payload): Json<serde_json::Value>,
) {
    app.custody()
        .handle_webhook(provider, &uri, &headers, payload)
        .await
        .unwrap_or(())
}
```

**Issue**: Accepts arbitrary JSON payloads from external sources without apparent input validation.

**Attack Vector**: Malicious webhooks could inject crafted payloads that might be reflected in logs or admin interfaces.

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement strict input validation for webhook payloads
- Sanitize any data that might be displayed in admin interfaces
- Add authentication/authorization for webhook endpoints

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: File Upload Security

**Location**: `core/document-storage/src/entity.rs:210-214`

```rust
let sanitized = filename
    .trim()
    .replace(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric() && c != '-', "-");
```

**Issue**: Basic filename sanitization may not prevent all file-based attacks.

**Attack Vector**: Crafted filenames could potentially bypass sanitization or cause issues when displayed.

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement more comprehensive filename validation
- Use allowlist approach for file extensions
- Store files with generated names, display original names separately

## Entry Points Analysis

### GraphQL Endpoints

**Admin Server**: 50+ mutation endpoints accepting user input
**Customer Server**: 10+ mutation endpoints accepting user input

**Entry Points Include**:
- Customer creation/updates (email, telegram ID)
- Financial transactions (deposits, withdrawals)
- Document uploads
- Configuration updates
- User management

**Security Assessment**: âœ… **SECURE**
- Strong typing with GraphQL schemas
- Rust's memory safety prevents buffer overflows
- No direct HTML rendering in backend

### Frontend Form Handling

**Components Analyzed**:
- Customer creation forms
- Financial transaction forms
- Configuration update forms
- File upload interfaces

**Security Assessment**: âœ… **MOSTLY SECURE**
- React automatically escapes content preventing XSS
- No usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- TypeScript provides type safety
- Form data properly handled through controlled components

### Authentication & Authorization

**Mechanisms**:
- JWT token validation (`lib/jwks-utils`)
- Role-based access control
- Permission set validation

**Security Assessment**: âœ… **SECURE**
- Proper JWT validation
- No authentication bypass vulnerabilities identified

## Recommended Security Enhancements

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix URL Parameter Injection**: Apply proper URL encoding in server actions
2. **Webhook Validation**: Implement input validation for webhook endpoints
3. **File Upload Hardening**: Enhance filename sanitization

### Additional Security Measures

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement strict CSP headers
2. **Input Validation Library**: Consider using a dedicated validation library
3. **Security Headers**: Ensure all security headers are properly configured
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Implement automated security scanning

### Code Review Guidelines

1. Always encode/escape user input before including in URLs or HTML
2. Validate all external input (webhooks, file uploads, API calls)
3. Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
4. Implement proper error handling without information disclosure

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Automated Testing**: Add XSS-specific test cases
2. **Manual Testing**: Regular penetration testing
3. **Input Fuzzing**: Test all input fields with malicious payloads
4. **File Upload Testing**: Test various file types and names

## Conclusion

The Lana Bank application demonstrates good security practices overall, with modern frameworks providing strong XSS protection by default. However, the identified vulnerabilities should be addressed to ensure comprehensive security. The URL parameter injection issue poses the highest risk and should be fixed immediately.

The application's use of Rust, TypeScript, and React provides a strong foundation for security, but vigilance in handling user input remains critical, especially at integration points like webhooks and file uploads.
