# DEPRECATED: This action is no longer needed
#
# Podman setup is now handled automatically by the Nix development shell.
# The flake.nix already includes podman and podman-compose as dependencies,
# and the devShell hook automatically configures podman sockets and environment variables.
#
# This approach is more robust and follows the same pattern used in Concourse CI.
#
# To use podman in workflows:
# 1. Use ./.github/actions/setup-nix 
# 2. Set ENGINE_DEFAULT=podman and CI=true environment variables
# 3. Run commands via `nix develop -c <command>`
#
# The Nix shell will automatically:
# - Provide podman and podman-compose binaries
# - Configure podman sockets in CI environments
# - Set appropriate environment variables
# - Handle both Linux and macOS correctly
