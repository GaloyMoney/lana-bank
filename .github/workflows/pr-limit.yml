          This PR has been automatically converted to **draft** because we've reached our team limit of **$MAX_PRS open PRs**.

          ### Why do we have this limit?
          To keep our review queue manageable and encourage faster iteration, we limit concurrent open PRs. This helps ensure PRs get reviewed and merged promptly rather than sitting idle.

          ### What should I do?
          1. **Help review** an existing open PR to get it merged
          2. Once an open PR is merged or closed, mark this PR as \"Ready for review\"

          ### Current open PRs
          $open_prs
