# Disbursal

Disbursals are the **principal amounts** sent to the customer.
Each disbursal records the amount released, links it to the facility and emits events that create new obligations.
Those obligations track the principal (and any fees) that must be repaid according to the facility terms.

For a step-by-step walkthrough of initiating and approving disbursals in the admin panel, see the [Admin Panel Guide: Credit Facilities](admin-guide.md#4-disbursal).
