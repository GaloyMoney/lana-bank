# Platform Engineering Guide

Welcome to the Lana platform engineering documentation. This section is for technical teams evaluating or deploying the platform.

## System Overview

Lana is a modern banking core built on:

- **Hexagonal Architecture** - Clean separation between domain logic, application services, and infrastructure
- **Event Sourcing** - Complete audit trail of all state changes
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Business logic organized around banking domain concepts
- **GraphQL APIs** - Flexible, strongly-typed API layer

## Documentation

### System Architecture

- [Functional Architecture](functional-architecture) - Comprehensive technical architecture
- [Authentication Architecture](authentication-architecture) - Keycloak, OAuth 2.0, gateway design

### Data Pipelines

- [Data Pipelines](data-pipelines) - Meltano, dbt, BigQuery

### Data Models
